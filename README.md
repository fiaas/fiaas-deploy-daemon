[![Build status](https://fiaas-svc.semaphoreci.com/badges/fiaas-deploy-daemon.svg?style=shields)](https://fiaas-svc.semaphoreci.com/projects/fiaas-deploy-daemon)

You need Python 2.7 and `pip`(7.x.x or higher)  on your `PATH` to work with fiaas-deploy-daemon.

Supported use-cases
-------------------

This application is written to support three separate use-cases:

- Normal: Running inside a cluster, deploying applications in the same cluster
- Bootstrap: Running outside a cluster, deploying itself into a specified cluster
- Development: Running outside a cluster, not actually deploying anything (dry-run)

A combination of command-line arguments and environment-variables control which use-case
is in effect, and how the application should act. There is no global flag to select a
use-case, instead the application will look at available information at each step and
determine its course of action.

See the config-module for more information.

Getting started with developing
-------------------------------

- First ensure you have the most recent version of setuptools for python2 with `pip install setuptools==44.0.0`. This is required for the following steps to work
- Use  `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- Make changes to code
Run tests with `tox`:
- `$ tox -e codestyle` checks code style, indentations etc.
- `$ tox -e test` runs unit tests
- `$ tox -e integration_test` runs end-to-end/integration tests. These tests require docker.

Running fiaas-deploy-daemon against a local `minikube` or `kind` backed Kubernetes cluster
-------------------------------------------

This workflow is intended for manual testing of fiaas-deploy-daemon against a live Kubernetes cluster while
developing.

To run fiaas-deploy-daemon locally and connect it to a local cluster, do the following:

* Set up development environment and install fiaas-deploy-daemon (`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`)

With kind:
* (See https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation for how to install and configure kind)
* Start kind: `$ kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.15.6`
* Run `$ bin/run_fdd_against_kind`

With minikube:
* (See https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/ for how to install and configure minikube)
* Start minikube: `$ minikube start`
* Run `$ bin/run_fdd_against_minikube`

There should be a bunch of logging while fiaas-deploy-daemon starts and initializes the required
CustomResourceDefinitions. This is normal.

If you need to test some behavior manually you can deploy applications into minikube via fiaas-deploy-daemon in a few ways:

#### Deploying an application via CustomResourceDefinition

In Kubernetes 1.7 and later you can deploy applications by creating a Application CustomResource

```yaml
apiVersion: fiaas.schibsted.io/v1
kind: Application
metadata:
  labels:
    app: example
    fiaas/deployment_id: test
  name: example
  namespace: default
spec:
  application: example
  image: nginx:1.13.0
  config:
    version: 3
    ingress:
      - host: example.com
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        enabled: false
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 128M
        cpu: 200m
      requests:
        memory: 64M
        cpu: 100m
```

Create the resource by saving this in a file like e.g. `example.yml` and then run
`$ kubectl --context minikube create -f example.yml`.


IntelliJ runconfigs
-------------------

#### Running fiaas-deploy-daemon

Use this configuration both for debugging and for manual bootstrapping into a cluster.

* Create a Python configuration with a suitable name: fiaas-deploy-daemon (dev)
* Script: Find the fiaas-deploy-daemon executable in the virtualenvs bin directory
    * If using bash, try `which fiaas-deploy-daemon` inside the virtualenv
* Script parameters:
    * --debug
    * If you want to deploy to a kubernetes cluster use --api-server, --api-token
     and --api-cert as suitable
* Python Interpreter: Make sure to add the virtualenv as an SDK, and use that interpreter


#### Tests

* Create a Python tests -> py.test configuration with a suitable name (name of test-file)
* Target: The specific test-file you wish to run
* Python Interpreter: Make sure to add the virtualenv as an SDK, and use that interpreter


fiaas-config
------------

fiaas-deploy-daemon will read a fiaas-config to determine how to deploy your application.
This configuration is a YAML file. If any field is missing, a default value will be used.
The default values, and explanation of their meaning are available at `/defaults` on any
running instance.


Release process
---------------

When changes are merged to master the master branch is built using [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com). The build generates a docker image that is published to the [fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiaas/fiaas-deploy-daemon) repository on Docker Hub and is publicly available.

Additionally as part of the master build process jobs for updating release channels for fiaas-deploy-daemon are executed. Release channels are used by [Skipper](https://github.com/fiaas/skipper) to manage FIAAS in a given cluster and it uses metadata from the release channels to determine which version of fiaas-deploy-daemon to install and when to upgrade as new versions become available.

Release channels are available via [Github pages](https://fiaas.github.io/releases) and metadata is source controlled in a [Github repository](https://github.com/fiaas/releases).

When the master branch is built successfully the `latest` release channel is updated with references to the docker image, build and commit for tracability.  The job for updating the `latest` release channel will persist the release metadata to the releases repository.

Similarly a job for updating the `stable` release channel is now pending but requires manual judgement and execution by a maintainer of the FIAAS organization for the release to be promoted to stable and the `stable` release channel to be updated.
