replicas:
  # Autoscaler scales from replicas.minimum to replicas.maximum (if minimum < maximum and maximum > 1). Need fiaas.resources.requests.cpu. Scales up on mean cpu utilisation of >cpu_threshold_percentage. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/horizontal-pod-autoscaling/
  minimum: 2 # Set minimum to the same as maximum for no autoscaling
  maximum: 5
  cpu_threshold_percentage: 50
ingress:
  - host: # Optional. External hostname to be exposed on. If defined (and at least one http port exists), Ingresses for {host}/{paths[x].path} is created. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/
    paths: # List of paths exposed to which application port
    - path: / # Path the application answers on
      port: http # Name of the port path is served on
healthchecks: # Healthchecks defined for your application. If omitted and a single port is defined, liveness will default to http or tcp depending on port type, and readiness will be a copy of liveness. If multiple ports are defined, healthchecks are not provided and should be defined explicitly
  liveness:
    # Valid configuration requires exactly one of execute|http|tcp
    execute:
      command: # Command to execute inside the container.
    http:
      path: /_/health # Path to GET
      port: http # port to connect to on the container. Must either be port number or name
      http_headers: {} # optional http headers (free form map)
    tcp:
      port: # tcp port number we will connect to on the container. Will receive a SYN and must complete the TCP handshake. Must either be port number or name
    initial_delay_seconds: 10 # Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated.
    period_seconds: 10 # How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
    success_threshold: 1 # Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.
    timeout_seconds: 1 # Number of seconds after which the probe times out.
  readiness: # If readiness is left out and liveness is defined, the readiness settings are copied from liveness.
    # Valid configuration requires exactly one of execute|http|tcp
    execute:
      command: # Command to execute inside the container.
    http:

    initial_delay_seconds: 10 # Number of seconds after the container has started before readiness probes are initiated.
    period_seconds: 10 # How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
    success_threshold: 1 # Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.

resources: # Optional. See: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
  limits:
    cpu: 400m # app will have its cpu usage throttled if exceeding this limit

metrics:
  prometheus:
    enabled: true # if false the pod will not be scraped for metrics by prometheus

  datadog:
    enabled: false # if true, attach a datadog sidecar
ports: # A list of ports the application listens on. For no exposed ports, specify as []
  - protocol: http # [http|tcp]
    name: http # A logical name for port discovery. Must be <= 63 characters and match [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? (DNS_LABEL)
    port: 80 # port number that will be exposed. For protocol=tcp, the available port range is (1024-32767).
